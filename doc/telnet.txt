Documentation for the telnet service -- 2016-11-13

The service takes two optional configuration settings which are read at boot
before the service is loaded :

  - telnet_port : a number indicating the port to listen to. If the port is not
                  set, the service defaults to port 23.

  - telnet_pass : a string corresponding to the password to type on the first
                  incoming connection. If the password is not set, the
                  concatenation of node.chipid(), node.flashid() and
                  node.flashsize() as-is in decimal form and without delimiter
                  constitutes de default password. These elements can also be
                  reported by esptool. Note that the flash size is in bytes.

The service relies on a TCP server to have been created and put into the
"tcpsrv" global variable.

The first incoming connection must authenticate, but subsequent ones will not
need to as long as at least one connection remains active. This ensures that
certain utilities like luatool can be used over the TCP socket provided that
one incoming connection has authenticated and remained active until the second
one comes in.
